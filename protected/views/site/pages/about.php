The ISIS Project Development Team is a key proponent to the organization’s purpose because we provide the simplest, most cost-effective solution and we can handle the development of complete turnkey Information Systems. The Project Development Team will like to meet with you to have discussion of a system request that would streamline our project management process. The project will improve our methods of interacting with clients and understanding their business profiles. The proposed system is a web-based client survey that stores and manages client business data for project development. Quality methodology of project development is critical to a successful solution that is on-time and on-budget. Our analyst is the proposed system’s end-user that uses the system to generate proposals to the client for services.

The analyst reviews the client’s business case, considering the company’s overall mission objectives and IT needs.
